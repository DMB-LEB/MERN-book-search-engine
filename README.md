# MERN-book-search-engine


## Description
Search and save books ussing Google Books API. I had struggled to deploy to heroku, I do not have an active link for this application.

## Installation
No installation needed to use the app, however to see what node packages were used please view the following package.json paths:
 - server/package.json
 - server/server.js
 - client/package.json


## Usage
Usage for an app like this would be best for all bookworms who want to look up books and save them to a list so that they can pull them up at a later time when they are ready to read them, and once read they can remove the books from their saved book list
